## Overview

The `neo-js` package is designed to interface with the **Neo** blockchain in a number of different ways that are configured by options that are used to initialize a node. A few examples of these different interaction mechanics are defined in the quickstart below as well as in the examples.

**note:** All blockchain events (Invocation and Deploy) use the RPC calls to interface with the blockchain unless they can be run locally (sometimes referred to as a 'test invoke')
